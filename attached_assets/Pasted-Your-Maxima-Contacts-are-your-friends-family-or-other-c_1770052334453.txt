Your Maxima Contacts are your friends, family or other connections that you wish to communicate with, peer-to-peer, without a centralised third-party being able to manage, collect or intercept your messages. Maintaining connectivity with each contact involves providing a small amount of Tx-PoW, in the same way that it is required for transacting over Minima, to contribute to the security of the blockchain. As a result, currently, it is reasonable for a node to have around 20 contacts. Any more and it may start to impact the node’s performance. Contact Addresses Similar to a wallet address used to receive funds on Minima, all users have a contact address which can be used to receive messages over Maxima. This communication is off-chain and uses peers on the network to ensure the encrypted message reaches the desired node. Contact addresses change at random time intervals, therefore contacts must always be added shortly after an address is shared. Once a contact is added, a user's Maxima Location Service host (mls) manages the connection between a user and their contacts to ensure they remain connected to their latest contact address.

Furthermore, the expiring nature of contact addresses prevents User B from being able to reach User A at the same contact address again, and allowing User A to become unreachable on Maxima if desired to avoid unwanted messages. Contact management The connection between you and your Contacts is maintained by your Maxima Location Service (MLS) host, a randomly selected server node on the Minima network. To learn more about MLS, see the Maxima Location Service page. Your Maxima Location Service (MLS) host is a randomly selected Minima node running on a server that ensures your Contacts always have your most recent contact address to reach you. Setting your Static MLS You may wish to become your own MLS or use another unchanging MLS to ensure a more stable with your contacts. You can set up your own MLS by running another Minima node on a server that is open on the main Minima port (default port 9001). By running your own MLS, your online Contacts will always remain connected to you via your server node, instead of using a randomly selected server node that could go offline and changes every 12 hours. To set your own static MLS host, from your server-based Minima node, find its P2P identity using the maxima command via the Minima Terminal.

Anyone wishing to contact you over Maxima can send you a message via your permanent MAX# address using: Terminal maxima action:send to:MAX#yourPubKey#staticMLSAddress application: data: Disabling contacts Having a permanent address means anyone who knows your MAX# address can add you as a contact which may not be desirable. To prevent anyone from adding you as a contact, from your primary node run the following command: Terminal maxextra action:allowallcontacts enable:false This will allow users who know your permanent MAX# address to send messages to your node, but will reject any requests to add you as a contact. Whitelisting contacts You can choose to whitelist specific people to allow them to add you as a contact, despite disabling contacts. Once allowed, they can add you as a contact and vice versa provided they have not disabled contacts. To whitelist someone, from your primary node run the following command, inserting their Maxima public key: Terminal maxextra action:addallowed publickey:INSERTPUBLICKEY Additional Help For additional help, please use the help commands from the Terminal: Terminal help command:maxima help command:maxcontacts help command:maxextraYour MLS ensures that, although your contact address expires periodically, you will remain connected to your contacts provided you connect to the network at least once in a 24-hour period. Maxima Contacts where C1, C2, C3 represent contacts When your contact address changes, your MLS host is informed and your online contacts are updated with your new address. For enhanced privacy, your node connects to a new MLS host every 12 hours. To ensure a smooth changeover, for 12 hours after moving to a new MLS host, your node remains connected with your previous MLS in case any of your contacts have been offline for longer than 12 hours. This ensures that if you remove a contact, they will not be able to re-add you after a maximum of 12 hours. Static MLS A static MLS is a dedicated, single server node that manages the connection to your contacts instead of relying on random nodes on the network. It can ensure a more stable connection with your contacts. To learn how to set a static MLS, see setting your static MLS. Permanent Addresses Permanent addresses can be configured if a non-expiring contact address is required, allowing new users to add you or message you at any time without having to provide them with your latest contact address. To enable a permanent address for your node, see setting up a permanent address.
